Install drivers for FTDI, UART USB-Serial:
    http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm

Plug GPS devices in one at a time and record port names (*nix) or numbers
(windows) for each device. Enter these values into the portnums section
for each device in gps_autoconf.m

Run gps_autoconf.m is matlab. You will see:
    Connected to Locosys
    Connected to Mediatek
    Connected to Ublox
    Connected to San_Jose
    Connected to Sirf_Star

Use fscanf n matlab to print messages from a device. Locosys for example:
    > out = fscanf(ports{locosys})
    out =
    GGA,000525.836,,,,,0,0,,,M,,M,,*47
    > out = fscanf(ports{locosys})
    out =
    ...
    $GPRMC,000525.836,V,,,,,0.00,0.00,060180,,,N*4D
    $PMTK001,220,3*30
    $PMTK001,314,3*36
    $GPGGA,000526.836,,,,,0,0,,,M,,M,
    $GPRMC,000542.836,V,,,,,0.00,0.00,060180,,,N*4C
    $GPGGA,000527.836,,,,,0,0,,,M,,M,,*45
    $GPRMC,000527.836,V,,,,,0.00,0.00,060180,,,N*4F
    $GPGGA,000528.836,,,,,0,0,,,M,,M,,*4A

    Note that the above results were obtains when running the scripts indoors.
